Change Log for the Are You A Human PHP Integration Library

1.1.7: 11/19/2012:
    - added AYAH_USE_CURL constant to ayah_config.php
    - refactored code to use new AYAH_USE_CURL constant.
    - refactored constructor to make it easier to add new parameters and config constants.

1.1.6: 11/12/2012:
    - minor change to doHttpsPost() so that it only uses cURL if the curl_exec() function is available.

1.1.5: 11/07/2012:
    - refactored ayah.php so that the class is only defined if it does not already exist.  This will
      help to eliminate PHP errors/warnings when implementing multiple PlayThrus on the same page.
    - added AYAH_DEBUG_MODE constant to the ayah_config.php file to make it easier for users to set
      debug mode to TRUE/FALSE.
    - added code to read/use the AYAH_DEBUG_MODE constant from the config file.
    - refactored __construct() to accept 'debug_mode' as an option in the $params array...also to
      make it easier for users to set debug mode to TRUE/FALSE.

1.1.4: 09/24/2012:
    - refactored __load_config_file() to not use __DIR__ because it is not supported in PHP
      versions prior to 5.3.0.

1.1.3: 09/12/2012:
    - fixed typo in debug message that prevented a debug value from displaying.
    - added a note about "Lightbox" to the header of the sample.php file.

1.1.2: 08/28/2012:
    - added the __load_config_file() function and refactored __construct() to use it.
        - this function looks for the ayah_config.php file in two places:
            1) the current directory
            2) the directory where the ayah.php file resides
    - refactored __log() to store messages into a buffer if debug mode is not on.
    - added the __flush_message_buffer() function and refactored debug_mode() to use it.
    - added log messages to show the current publisher key, scoring key and AYAH webservice hots.

1.1.1: 08/09/2012:
    - moved code that includes ayah_config.php into __construct() and log a debug message if not found.
    - added code to getPublisherHTML() to check that site is able to connect to AYAH webservice.
    - added code to getPublisherHTML() to support setting runtime options.
    - fixed minor bug in doHttpsPost()

1.1.0: 07/25/2012:
    - added public functions:
        - debug_mode()
        - get_version_number()
    - refactored error logging to use debug_mode().
    - minor refactoring to several routines to make them easier to read/maintain.
    - fixed bug in doJSONArrayDecode().

1.0.2: 03/21/2012:
    - Changed the script tag to include language="JavaScript" and type="text/javascript" for maximum compatibility.

1.0.1: 12/12/2011:
    - Add fallback support for JSON decode with Michal Migurski's library
    - Add fallback support when there is no cURL library
    - Changed the handling for the constants so that, if they don't exist, it doesn't freak out
    - Changed the handling for ayah_config.php so that, if it doesn't exist, it doesn't freak out
